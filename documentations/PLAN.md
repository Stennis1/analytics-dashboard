# EventFlow Project Plan

This document outlines the architecture and implementation plan for the EventFlow Analytics Dashboard.

## 1. Core Features

- **Session & Attendee Tracking:** Display a detailed list of all event sessions, 
including title, speaker, and the number of attendees.
- **Real-time Analytics Dashboard:** Provide a high-level overview of key event
 metrics on a central dashboard.
- **Interactive Data Visualizations:** Include charts and graphs to visualize 
data, such as attendance trends over time and session popularity comparisons.
- **Dynamic Filtering:** Allow event organizers to filter the displayed 
sessions by date, speaker, or other criteria to find specific information quickly.
- **Performance & Accessibility:** Ensure the application is fast, 
responsive, and accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.

## 2. Component Hierarchy

The application will be structured with the following component tree:

- `App` (Root component, manages all state and logic)
    - `Header` (Displays the application title and view toggle)
    - `ErrorBoundary` (Wraps components that might fail, providing a UI fallback)
        - `Dashboard` (Conditional view for analytics)
            - `MetricsDisplay` (Shows key numbers like total attendance, average rating)
            - `AttendanceChart` (Displays a bar or line chart for attendance data)
        - `SessionList` (Conditional view for detailed session list)
            - `FilterControls` (Contains dropdowns and inputs for filtering)
            - `SessionItem` (Displays information for a single session)

## 3. Data Flow Architecture

### State Management

The primary application state will be "lifted" to the top-level `App` component. 
This centralized approach makes the data flow predictable and easier to debug.

The `App` component will manage:
- The complete list of all session data.
- The current filter settings (e.g., `{ date: '2023-10-26', speaker: 'Jane Doe' }`).
- The current view being displayed ('Dashboard' or 'SessionList').

### Data Flow Diagram

Data will flow unidirectionally from the `App` component down to 
child components via props. Actions from child components will be 
communicated up to `App` via callback functions.

`User Interaction (e.g., changes a filter in FilterControls)`
`    |`
`    v`
`Callback Function (e.g., onFilterChange() passed from App)`
`    |`
`    v`
`App Component updates its state (setFilters)`
`    |`
`    v`
`React re-renders the UI`
`    |`
`    v`
`Child Components (Dashboard, SessionList) receive new, filtered data as props and display it`

## 4. Implementation Phases

The project will be developed in the following phases, mirroring the course structure:

- **Phase 1: Project Planning & Design (Module 1)**
    - **Goal:** Create all necessary architectural plans and documentation.
    - **Outcome:** This `PLAN.md` file and detailed component/data specifications.

- **Phase 2: Core Implementation & Accessibility (Module 2)**
    - **Goal:** Build the functional, accessible, and deployed version of the application.
    - **Outcome:** A working UI with session lists, a dashboard with charts, 
        and full accessibility features, deployed to Azure.

- **Phase 3: Performance Optimization (Module 3)**
    - **Goal:** Identify performance bottlenecks and refactor the code to be highly efficient.
    - **Outcome:** An optimized application that uses memoization to 
        prevent unnecessary calculations.

- **Phase 4: Career Development & Portfolio Prep (Module 4)**
    - **Goal:** Finalize project documentation and prepare it for a professional portfolio.
    - **Outcome:** A polished GitHub repository with a  comprehensive README and case study.
